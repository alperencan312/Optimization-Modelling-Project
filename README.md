# Optimization-Modelling-Project
This is an IE400 project of Bilkent University, involving mathematical modelling and related constaints of given problems.

See the Final Report for detailed explanation of the solutions. As an optimization solver, IBM's CPLEX has been used.

I would like thank to my friend, Yiğit Önen, for his consultation. This project assignment is given by Dr. Özlem Karsu, under the supervision of our teaching assistants Ms. Büşra Bayrak and Mr. Batuhan Çelik.
